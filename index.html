            <p>Open-Code-Community is as the name says a public platform. We want to give everyone the option, to realize software projects with other developers. It doesn’t matter what programing language you like to use and how crazy your project ideas are. <br> For project synchronization, we use GitHub. We have our own organization (<a href="https://github.com/open-code-community">https://github.com/open-code-community</a>), in which you can save your projects.<br> As a platform to exchange your ideas and coordinate your projects, we use a Discord Server. There you will find users with the rank “Staff”. These are contact people if you are having a problem. If you have ideas you are encouraged to share them. In case they get approval by others, we will create a new Repository and you can start with the development. Taking part in existing projects is possible via Pull Request on GitHub.<br> We also want to build a community. We want to make decisions with our users and users will be able to have a say in upcoming topics.<br><br> We hope you will have a lot of fun and successful projects!</p>
